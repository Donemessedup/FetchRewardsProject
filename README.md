# FetchRewardsProject
Hey Fetch Rewards, I'm Aaron Miller. I'm a recent graduate from Gonzaga with a Bachelors in Computer Science looking for my first job in the Computer Science field. I have some experience working with machine learning from a Data Science Algorithms course I took Senior year and would love to expand on that knowledge and learn how to apply it in the real world. 
### Docker Container
I've attached a Dockerfile to the repo, but if that doesn't work than you can pull the container I used from docker hub using "docker pull continuumio/anaconda3:2021.11". If you have any issues let me know.
